  ## Installation
  
  No installation necessary; please navigate to https://incredible-note-taker.herokuapp.com/ to use the deployed version of this app!
  
  ## Usage
  
    The user begins on a landing page, where they click on a button marked 'Get Started' in order to launch the application. This takes them to a page where they can enter a new note title and a corresponding note. They are then given a button to save their note. When they do so, the note populates on the left hand side of the screen, and they can click on any note in this history to view it again. At any time, they can click the button marked '+' in order to create a new note. There is also a trash can icon associated with each note in the history that allows them to delete that note.
